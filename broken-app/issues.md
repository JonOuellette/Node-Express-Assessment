# Broken App Issues
1. **Missing JSON Body Parser**: The app did not include middleware to parse JSON request bodies.

2. **Improper Asynchronous Handling**: The original code did not properly handle asynchronous calls to the GitHub API.

3. **Lack of Input Validation**: There was no validation to check if the provided input was in the expected array format.

4. **Error Handling**: The error handling was not properly set up. The `catch` block referenced `err` but used `next` without the error argument.

5. **Code Organization**: The function to fetch data from the GitHub API was embedded within the route, making the code less readable and harder to maintain.

6. **Response Method**: The code used `res.send(JSON.stringify(output))` instead of the more appropriate `res.json(output)`.
